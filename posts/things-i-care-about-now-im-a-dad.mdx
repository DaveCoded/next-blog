## Sleep

<Dropcap>My</Dropcap> sleep. My wife's sleep. My child's sleep. I'm obsessed. With length, with frequency, with quality.
Why? The lurking lower bound.
That rock bottom which is only known once hit.
There's a point at which we're not getting enough. And then?
Things. Fall. Apart.

## Physical accessibility in public transport

I cared about this before. I did. Just in the most passive way possible. It didn't affect _me_,
which made it easy to forget about. I never took the lift. Not when exhausted or battered or luggage-laden.
But I do now. And so, what if it's out of order? Well, I can ask for help; most people like helping a parent
with a cute baby. But if none is forthcoming? I can make do. Awkwardly, yes. And not without some huffing and
cursing. But ultimately, those steps are conquered.

There are people who cannot _make do_. They have no choice when it comes to what they must rely upon.

## Hot, powerful showers

These used to be long, lingering affairs. Decadent. Hedonistic. Now, they're a vital
rejuvenation<MarginNote id="1">Literally, to make young again</MarginNote>.
Muscles slacken, brows soften, cares flatten. They wash away sticky, milky spit.
They grant escape for just a hot minute<MarginNote id="2">It's their brevity that makes fleeting moments precious</MarginNote>.

## Safety

The cantilevered parasol creaks as it sways in a moderate wind. I'll be fucked if I'm going to be
the dickhead who didn't heed his instincts and has his baby crushed by a garden extravagance.

## Women

Women who are having, have had, or will have children.

I cared about women before having a child. And I knew well enough about many inequities women must
endure—I work in tech, after all. But in pregnancy, birth, postpartum care, there are too many things
that a woman's partner cannot bear for them<MarginNote>Putting aside the barely veiled misogyny of the
Christian myth of Eve eating (of) the apple, I can see where it came from. Surely the first woman must
have pissed off some capricious, omnipotent fucker.</MarginNote>.

I cannot share morning sickness. I cannot bear our child's weight as they gestate. I cannot sleep uncomfortably so my wife may have relief. I cannot have my organs rearranged—my stomach squashed, my lungs compressed—so that she might eat full meals and take full breaths. I cannot give birth. I cannot recover from birth. I cannot feed our child with my body. I cannot imbalance my own hormones to stabilise hers. I cannot overheat and sweat through the night and rob myself of precious hours to give her peaceful sleep. I cannot change paternity laws (not overnight).

And so my empathy is fresh and vital. I exercise it daily. And so I care about women.
