<MyBackground>

❤️ **Powerful**: MDX blends markdown and JSX syntax to fit perfectly in
React/JSX-based projects.
💻 **Everything is a component**: Use existing components inside your
MDX and import other MDX files as plain components.
🔧 **Customizable**: Decide which component is rendered for each markdown

📚 **Markdown-based**: The simplicity and elegance of markdown remains,
you interleave JSX only when you want to.
🔥 **Blazingly blazing fast**: MDX has no runtime, all compilation occurs
during the build stage.
[MDX](https://mdxjs.com) is markdown for component era.

```js{1}:index.js
const avarice = () => {
    console.log('Give me all your money!')
}
```
