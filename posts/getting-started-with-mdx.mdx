## What's so great about MDX anyway?

### Third level heading. Not too shabby eh?

**Powerful**: MDX blends markdown and JSX syntax to fit perfectly in
React/JSX-based projects.
ðŸ’» **Everything is a component**: Use existing components inside your
MDX and import other MDX files as plain components.
**Customizable**: Decide which component is rendered for each markdown

**Markdown-based**: The simplicity and elegance of markdown remains,
you interleave JSX only when you want to.
ðŸ”¥ **Blazingly blazing fast**: MDX has no runtime, all compilation occurs
during the build stage.
[MDX](https://mdxjs.com) is markdown for component era.

#### This is a fourth level heading if you'll believe that. But you'd believe anything, **I suppose**. DAMN!

Let's have a blockquote to style shall we? I'm first going to include a bunch of text like this. Oh! And here's a [link to style](https://www.google.com)

have some inline code too: `console.log('your face is way to big');`

Now I'm going to lead in to this massive text block:

```jsx{1}:index.js
const themes = {
    light: {
        foreground: "#000000",
        background: "#eeeeee"
    },
    dark: {
        foreground: "#ffffff",
        background: "#222222"
    }
};

const ThemeContext = React.createContext(themes.light);

function App() {
    return (
        <ThemeContext.Provider value={themes.dark}>
            <Toolbar />
        </ThemeContext.Provider>
    );
}

function Toolbar(props) {
    return (
        <div>
            <ThemedButton />
        </div>
    );
}

const ThemedButton = () => {
    const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
    return (
        <button style={{ background: theme.background, color: theme.foreground }}>
            I am styled by theme context!
        </button>
    );
}
```

I'm going to include some images now, because they're nice and I'll probably want to use some in blog posts at some point. Maybe for my ART or somefink.
Come to think on it, the best way to do a blog series would just be to have some kind of React component that linked to the relevant posts at the top,
to keep the titles related, e.g. "Awesome Git tips: part one - interactive rebase", "Awesome Git tips: part two - managing the staging area" etc.
This is from public

<img src="/cog.png" width={400} height={400} alt="This is an image!" />
