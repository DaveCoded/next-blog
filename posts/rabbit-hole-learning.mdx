### Outline

- Introduction: Why is it important to have a _strategy_?
- Disclaimer: Not for new devs necessarily
- It's easy to get distracted by new things in tech. We have to fight these distractions
  right? Maybe, but actually, a key to success is to learn widely.
- Why is this? It's all about drawing connections. The more things you have to draw
  connections to, the easier and faster you'll learn new things.
- Allow yourself to become distracted, not by the latest, shiniest things, but by whatever
  catches _your_ attention. The things that you're motivated to learn deeply, to go down
  the rabbit hole on, those are the things that will benefit you the most and that you'll
  learn the most from, even if it seems unrelated to your work. I'm a frontend developer;
  I should be learning more full-stacky things for work, and I am, but I recently
  discovered competetive programming and that I enjoy Dynamic Programming problems. If I
  follow that line of enquiry, I'll learn a lot about algorithms, low-level languages and
  the way they implement and make use of different data structures. How could that be a
  bad thing?

<p>
  <Dropcap>There</Dropcap> is an overwhelming amount to learn as a developer. Too much, in
  fact, to ever learn everything that you'll want to. But, looking at others in the
  community, my seniors and betters (who are more and more often, depressingly, not my
  seniors), it is certainly possible to become a good programmer, be involved in
  developing great software, and to learn more than enough to bring you immense
  satisfaction and endless wonder as you do so.

This is my take on how to prioritize what to learn. Of course it won't be for everyone,
but I believe that adopting it _to some degree_ will help most people who struggle with
this.
