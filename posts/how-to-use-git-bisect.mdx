## Outline

- Introduction: I'm going to tell you about how I went about finding a bug in production.
  It turns out, I could have done the same thing much quicker with `git bisect`, so skip
  ahead for that. Mention that it may not have been Linus responsible for the feature.
- Give context for the bug. It was merged into master/main but nobody knew when because it
  was a relatively unused feature of a program with only a few beta users.
- Go through the process of hunting it down. Checking out some commits, thinking of using
  binary search, then finding a snippet with good arguments for `git log` that helped
  narrow down commits that were merges into master.
- Explain how `git bisect` does the same and show the basic commands. Link to the proper
  documentation or show how to pull up the `man` page for it.
- Show how to narrow down the selection of commits that you want to consider and credit
  Shiva Rajagopal for this great post: https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/git-bisect
- Write a bit about how learning `git` well, not just the basic features, is very
  beneficial. Advocate for more sharing of good tips etc.
