## Outline

- Introduction: I'm going to tell you about how I went about finding a bug in production.
  It turns out, I could have done the same thing much quicker with `git bisect`, so skip
  ahead for that. Mention that it may not have been Linus responsible for the feature.
- Give context for the bug. It was merged into master/main but nobody knew when because it
  was a relatively unused feature of a program with only a few beta users.
- Go through the process of hunting it down. Checking out some commits, thinking of using
  binary search, then finding a snippet with good arguments for `git log` that helped
  narrow down commits that were merges into master.
- Explain how `git bisect` does the same and show the basic commands. Link to the proper
  documentation or show how to pull up the `man` page for it.
- Show how to narrow down the selection of commits that you want to consider and credit
  Shiva Rajagopal for this great post: https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/git-bisect
- Write a bit about how learning `git` well, not just the basic features, is very
  beneficial. Advocate for more sharing of good tips etc.

  <Dropcap>Until</Dropcap> no people are involved in the process, writing software will
  always produce bugs. Many are preventable with good practices and checks in place. Many
  can be caught by automated tests or a rigorous QA team before they are released and
  cause any great damage. But there will always be some that escape us, making their way
  into production.

At such a time, we are likely to panic to some degree. How much depends on what the
software does, how many people rely on it, how frequently they use it and how your company
and colleagues react. Making this manner of mistake on a small SaaS product with an
infrequent user base and a relaxed company culture will feel very different to doing it
for a large payment-processing organisation used several hundred times a second
internationally.

But panic is no use to us at this point.<MarginNote id={1}>Putting aside that fact that a
visceral emotional response may be useful in convincing us that something should be taken
seriously.</MarginNote>
