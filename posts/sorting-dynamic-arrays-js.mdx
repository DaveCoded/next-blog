<Dropcap>
    Often in code, you will be expecting an array of items. Sometimes you will know their types but
    not their number. Sometimes you will even know the complete list of possible values, but not
    their number. What if that is the case and you want to sort them in a particular order? Not
    alphabetically, or from most to least recent, or from long to short, or anything programmatic.
    You want to sort them according to something that seems, at least to a dumb computer, entirely
    arbitrary (laughable, even). Alphabetically according to which letter corresponds to your
    favourite numbers between 1 and 26. Or according to a list of label names for the form inputs in
    a UI? Yeah, that one. That's what happened to me.
</Dropcap>

## My specific use case

I was building a form at work, but I didn't know exactly what all the inputs were going to be. I knew what they _could_ be - it's
my job to, after all - but the specific subset of all possibilities depended on a user's previous input into the application. Pesky user ðŸ™„
Dynamically building a form is all very well, but what about the order of the inputs? There are reasonably established patterns to follow here.
You wouldn't, for instance, stand for being asked to enter your grandmother's vet's email address before you were even cordially asked
for your own name.

### Vegetables as an example

Let's take vegetables as an example. We are going to get an array of vegetables as strings. We know all the possible vegetables, but we
don't know the subset, or what order they'll come in. _But_, being unnecessarily opinionated programmers, we know the order we absolutely
must display them in. First let's make an array describing our preference, given all possible vegetables that exist in the app:

```JavaScript:veggies.js
const idealVegOrder = [
    'Daikon',
    'Broccoli',
    'Runner beans',
    'Sweetcorn',
    'Carrots',
    'Onions'
]
```

### The chaos of actual data

What if our user didn't put little ticks in all the checkboxes earlier in the app confirming that they're a fan of all these vegetables?
And what if the way we get their inconvenient subset of vegetables doesn't keep them in the neat order we absolutely require? Say this is
the array of vegetables that our user fancies:

```JavaScript:veggies.js
const userVeggies = ['Broccoli', 'Carrots', 'Daikon', 'Onions'];
```

### Daikon must come first! ðŸ˜¡

Don't worry, I'll stop rambling and give you the snippet now. Here's how we can order the chaos of user data according to our nirvana
of cruciferous order:

```JavaScript:veggies.js
const sortVeggies = (userVeggiesArray) => {
    const idealVegOrder = [
        'Daikon',
        'Broccoli',
        'Runner beans',
        'Sweetcorn',
        'Carrots',
        'Onions'
    ];

    return userVeggiesArray.sort(
        (a, b) => idealVegOrder.indexOf(a) - idealVegOrder.indexOf(b)
    );
}

const userVeggies = getUserVeggies(user); // ['Broccoli', 'Carrots', 'Daikon', 'Onions']

const orderedUserVeggies = sortVeggies(userVeggies); // ['Daikon', 'Broccoli', 'Carrots', 'Onions']
```

Hooray! I know this isn't going to set the internet on fire, but hopefully it will help one or two people on their coding journeys. Peace ðŸŒ½ðŸ¥¦ðŸ¥•
(Who wants to [put in a proposal](https://unicode.org/emoji/proposals.html) for a Daikon emoji?)
