## History

- "It was first proposed by Edgar F. Codd as part of his relational model." (wikipedia)

## What is database normalization?

- It concerns how we _structure_ a relational (usually) database
- The aim is to reduce data redundancy and to improve data integrity
- We do this by adhering to the "**normal forms**"

### Data redundancy

- Essentially the duplication of data in multiple records, either within a table or across multiple tables
- Can lead to corruption of data, or just increased storage requirements

### Data integrity

- Ensuring the persistence and retention of data

## 3 kinds of anomaly

There are three main dangers for databases that have not been normalized:

### Update anomaly

- When you have the same data expressed in multiple places, they must be updated together
- Therefore, if for any reason an update is only partially successful, some records may update while others do not
- It is then possible to get two different answers to the same query

### Insertion anomaly

- When you need to add a record to a table that can't because of the specified columns
- Wikipedia example gives faculty members as below:

<FacultyTable />

- Now imagine a new member starts, but is not yet teaching a course. Their Course Code
  would have to be given as `null`

### Deletion anomaly

- This is when deleting data holding one fact necessarily deletes data holding another fact
- The Faculty Table suffers from this anomaly. If you delete a course, you will also delete
  the faculty member, unless the course code is set to `null`

## Principle: extensions should require minimal redesign

- You should be able to add new types of data to a database without changing its structure too much
- Each change in structure could potentially break existing applications that interact with the data

## The normal forms
