  <Dropcap>Regex</Dropcap> can be really powerful, but remember that it comes in different
  flavours, can be difficult to decipher, and has its limitations.

One powerful feature is the negative lookahead, using the `?!` syntax. When combined with
`.*`, we can chekc that a pattern is not contained anywhere in a string:

```js
;/^(?!.*(JavaScript|TypeScript))/.test('I love all the parentheses in Lisp') // true => string does not contain "JavaScript" or "TypeScript"

;/^(?!.*(JavaScript|TypeScript))/.test("It looks like JavaScript isn't going away") // false
```

If you want to test for the presence of one pattern, but the absence of another, you can
use the `.*` syntax again. The following will match strings containing John, that don't
also contain Yoko:

```js
;/^(?!.*Yoko).*John/.test('John and Yoko were both artists') // false => string contains Yoko

;/^(?!.*Yoko).*John/.test('I wonder what John would have thought of the internet') // true => string contains John, but not Yoko
```
