<Dropcap>Whoops!</Dropcap> I've borked it again. [[The creative process as heroin:Custom text you like]] One of my commits contained my changes to the yarn.lock.<MarginNote id={1}>...that only work with *my* local environment because web development with billions of node modules is just wonderful</MarginNote>

And I've pushed it and a PR's open and I'm *this* close 🤏 to throwing my laptop out the window.

> Don't worry. git can handle it. And some hero told me how on SO

Now, I've been working on a branch named `dave/made-a-dumb-error-again`, which branched off `dev`. So, I can just run:

```shell
git checkout dev -- yarn.lock
```

And I'm saved thanks to [this SO answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38743912/remove-a-file-from-a-git-pull-request). Many thanks to [Jared Wilber](https://www.jwilber.me/) for saving my bacon.
