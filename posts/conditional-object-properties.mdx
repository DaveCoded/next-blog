If you have an object literal in JavaScript, and you want to add a property to it only if
some condition is met, you're in luck. The neatest way is with the spread operator,
introduced in ES6.

```JavaScript title=conditional-property.js
const isConditional = true;

const myObject = {
    type: 'excellent',
    size: 'enormous',
    aromas: ['jasmine', 'honeysuckle', 'puddle water'],
    ...(isConditional && { optionalProperty: true })
}
```

As you can see, how this actually works syntactically, is by spreading an object -
`{ optionalProperty: true }` - into our existing object literal if a certain condition is
met. Handy stuff ðŸ¤š
