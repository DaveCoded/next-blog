## Outline

- Disclaimer: I'm reading PragProg which may just be better than other books, but I doubt
- It's largely about thinking while you code. Because I'm reading about DRY, I'm thinking
  about duplication (of knowledge and intent, not just code). But more than that, I'm
  thinking about how programs should be structured, about documentation and software
  generally, even when I'm just trying to make my code work.
- Thinking deeply about what you're writing when you code makes it _way_ more enjoyable.
- Books are usually better researched by virtue of their being books, havign editors,
  publishers, and being more permanent than web content, which can be more ephemeral and
  therefore vague.
- Something well-researched will point you to other great books/articles. (Link to your
