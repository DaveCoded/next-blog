  Self-hosting web fonts is the best font-loading strategy
  for many websites. Done correctly, it yields the best
  performance results and gives you the most options and
  flexibility. The only reason to avoid it might be that you
  get too much control, which puts the onus of understanding
  how to optimise web fonts all on you. But that's another
  matter entirely.

And the idea is simple. Put the font files in a directory that
serves assets to the client - usually `public/`. Then, in a css
file, load the fonts with `@font-face`. The details of the implementation
are outside of the scope of this post, but I would recommend
this [CSS tricks article](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/using-font-face/)
if you need help.

The issue with this strategy comes when you have a static site - such as the one you're on now, which is built with Next.js - deployed on Netlify.
(It's a fantastic service that I'm grateful for; this isn't really a critique.) The common way <MarginNote id={2}>Possibly the best way, or the only way.
Certainly the path of least resistance and one with many DX benefits.</MarginNote> to deploy static sites on Netlify, is to configure a branch
to watch on GitHub. Any merge into that branch triggers a deployment and, in a flash, the new version of your site is built and deployed
to the web.

In this model, your assets - fonts, images, favicon etc. - are also usually kept in a `public/` or `static/` directory. And since Netlify
gets your project files from GitHub, those assets that you're choosing to host also need to go on GitHub.

## How does font piracy fit in here?

It's now common enough, if you have more than a handful, to have images hosted on a CDN. And, because images can take some time to load, the very little
amount of time it takes to make a request for those images, is negligible. Doing the same for your fonts _is_ an option, but the extra network
request it would take is a considerable performance penalty, and you lose out on the option to preload or subset fonts<MarginNote id={3}>For the full low-down
on font-loading performance, I recommend Simon Hearne's [excellent and conmprehensive article](https://simonhearne.com/2021/layout-shifts-webfonts/)</MarginNote> to your liking.
