  Self-hosting web fonts is the best font-loading strategy
  for many websites. And the idea is simple. Put the font
  files in directory that serves assets to the client -
  usually public/. Then, in a css file, load the fonts with{' '}
  <code>@import</code> or <code>@font-face</code>. The
  details of the implementation are outside of the scope of
  this post, but I would recomment{' '}

The issue with this strategy comes when you have a static site - such as the one you're on now, which is built with Next.js - deployed on Netlify.
(It's a fantastic service that I'm grateful for; this isn't really a critique.) The common way <MarginNote>Possibly the best way, or the only way.
Certainly the path of least resistance and one with many DX benefits.</MarginNote> to deploy static sites on Netlify, is to configure a branch
to watch on GitHub. Any merge into that branch triggers a deploy, and in a flash, the new version of your site is built and deployed
to the web.

In this model, your assets - fonts, images, favicon etc. - are also usually kept in a `public/` or `static/` directory. And since Netlify
gets your project files from GitHub, those assets that you're choosing to host also need to go on GitHub.

## How does font piracy fit in here?

It's now common enough, if you have more than a handful, to have images hosted on a CDN. And, because images can take some time to load, the very little
amount of time it takes to make a request for those images, is negligible. Doing the same for your fonts _is_ an option. BUT FOR VARIOUS REASONS,
HOSTING THME YOURSELF CREATES A BETTER EXPERIENCE - **you need to research and justify this to turn this into a more long-form essay. If there is**
