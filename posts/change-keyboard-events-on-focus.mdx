## Outline (make this one short)

- Why would you need to do this? If you want to handle a keyboard event in a certain way,
  unless your user was using an input, for example.
- My use case: making a modal where we wanted pressing enter to close the modal, as if the
  "Done" button had been pressed, but we wanted to allow pressing Enter in a textarea to
  create a linebreak.
- How to do it in JavaScript.
- How to do it in React/Typescript.
