    It was probably the capsicum that just tipped it. Lesson learned.

I'm not going to claim that this opinion is novel. I'm sure I've read something similar
myself some time ago. But it's something I've arrived at through my own experience of
writing tests, and so in that sense, it is _original_. And besides, I believe it to be
worth reiterating. Not least because it's a tenet that I am frequently guilty of
forgetting myself.

## TDD light, or Diet TDD

I very rarely use test-driven development. When I do, it's usually because I need to write
a complex function that covers some gnarly edge cases. And usually, I have a clear idea of
input and output so that the test cases are the easiest place to start. I find, in these
circumstances, that the greatest advantage of starting with tests is the clarity of
thought I gain. Once the test cases are written, not only am I crystal clear on what I'm
trying to acheive with my code, but I have them to hand as a constant reminder. It keeps
me focused while I write the implementation.

So why aren't I recommending TDD? In part, because it's a TLA.<MarginNote id={2}>Three
Letter Acronym. Har-dee-har-har.</MarginNote> And because words such as "ethos" and
"philosophy" are erroneously attached to it. Once you start to recommend an approach,
people get dogmatic and start wanting rules to follow, blindfolds to wear and teats to
suckle. And I want better for you.<MarginNote id={3}>There are also plenty of occasions
when writing code is more exploratory, when some of the thinking is best done while
immersed in a system's guts, rather than trying to reason about it all from the
outside.</MarginNote>

Instead of having all your test cases planned out beforehand, I think it's enough to try
to write code that is easy to test. It just so happens that writing code that is easy test
means writing code that is easy to reason about and nicely decoupled from dependencies.
Because dependencies are easy to mock when you've thought about how they're integrations,
and they're devils if not.

## Easy-to-test React components

When it comes to React, testing becomes much easier when following these four
_guidelines_:<MarginNote id={4}>Yep; they're just guidelines. Don't go sticking to them
against your better judgement</MarginNote>

1. Add ids to interactive elements to give yourself unambiguous selectors for targeting
   elements from tests. Or, if you want to be more explicit, use data attributes, such as
   `data-testid`.
2. Write smaller, composable components that follow the single responsibility principle
   (where possible). The smaller your component, the less there is to test at once. It
   also makes it more apparent what cases there are to test, which means you're less
   likely to leave edge cases uncovered.
3. If a function does not need to be in the body of a component, move it to the
   file/module level, or to a helper file if it's reusable. That way you can call and make
   assertions directly on that function without having to trigger an event that calls it.
4. If you have the choice and it makes sense to do so in the source code, prefer defining
   functions in parent components and passing them to children via props over defining and
   calling functions in the same component. Any component prop is trivial to mock; when
   you mount the component for testing, you can replace that prop with whatever you like.

## Tips for using Enzyme

### Mounting / Rendering a wrapper

When you mount a component, use `shallow()` to test it in isolation, and `mount()` if you
need access to nested components and elements. `mount` is a more expensive operation, so
don't use it unnecessarily; you won't notice a difference at first, but I promise you will
when you have to run hundreds or thousands of tests.

When debugging a test, it can be useful to see what Enzyme is actually rendering. Do this
by adding `console.log(wrapper.debug())` (where the mounted component tree has been
assigned to `wrapper`) and running the test again. The rendered wrapper will be logged to
your terminal as long as no errors are thrown before executing the log statement. And when
shallow rendering, optionally pass `debug({ verbose: true })` for more information on the
rendered elements' props.

If you expect the elements in the wrapper to change as a result of an action - you
simulate a click, a `useEffect` hook executes etc. - then call `wrapper.update()` before
making an assertion. And if the action was asynchronous, you may have to `await`, or call
this handy `nextTick()` utility:

```js
const nextTick = () =>
  new Promise((resolve, reject) => process.nextTick(() => resolve(searchData)))
```

### Simulating events and calling functions passed as props

Enzyme has its own method for simulating events. To simulate a button click, for instance,
you can find the button element on the wrapper and pass `'click'` to the `simulate`
method:

```JSX
const button = wrapper.find('#test-button');
button.simulate('click');
```

Be aware, however, that while this is usually ok for clicks, many events do not behave
well with the `simulate` method. It's more reliable to, where possible, call an event
directly via an element's props:

```JSX
const input = wrapper.find('#test-input');
const onChange = input.prop('onChange');
onChange({
    event: {
        target: 'new input value'
    }
});
```

Since the `prop()` method can return `undefined`, TypeScript does not know if a value will
be found on any prop, so you will have to guard against that case.

### Events and casting types

These synthetic React events, when found and triggered directly, know to expect a certain
event object. TypeScript will fail to compile until it is reassured that you have passed
an appropriate event object. You can do this with type casting:

```JSX
const onChange = input.prop('onChange');
const changeEventMock = {
    target: {
        value: 'testing'
    }
} as unknown as React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>;

if (onChange) {
    onChange(changeEventMock);
}
```

- Be sure to also mock any event methods that are actually called in the source code, e.g.
  `preventDefault()` or `stopPropagation()`.

- Casting types is also useful for mocking class instances. Tests run faster if you mock
  what you need to test in, for example, a user object, rather than instantiating a
  `new AppUser()` with _all_ of its methods and properties.

- Be aware that type casting does not, however, make your mock an instance of that class.
  So if the source code uses the `instanceof` operator or needs the instance's prototype,
  you will in fact have to create an instance of the class.

- `as unknown` is only necessary when your mock is a very different shape to the type you
  are casting your mock as.

### Events that call React hooks

If you call an event that results in the firing of a React hook, you will need to wrap it
in `act` from the 'react-test-renderer' package to ensure the hook takes effect, and then
update the wrapper (if you expect a change in the element tree):

```JSX
import { act } from 'react-test-renderer';

...

if (onChange) {
    act(() => onChange(onChangeMock));
}
wrapper.update();
```

## Spying, mocking and stubbing with Sinon

### Spies

To assert on a method, by expecting it to run a certain number of times or with certain
arguments, _without hijacking its execution_, you can use a "spy". This is especially
useful if you want to test that something is logged to the console, for instance:

```js
import sinon from 'sinon';
...
const consoleSpy = sinon.spy(console, 'error');

// Execute code path that logs an error in the console
expect(consoleSpy.calledOnce).to.be.true;
```

### Fakes

Fakes are mock functions that capture details about how they were called. They are like
spies, only instead of calling the original function, the implementation is completely
replaced. In fact, you can use a fake to return a value, resolve a value (if mocking an
async function), and even thrown an error or reject a Promise.

Consider this example, which tests that a modal will close when the "done" button is
clicked.

- Note how we're not **_really_** checking that the modal is closed. We're checking that
  the function which closes the modal is called in the correct circumstances. This is
  because we are interested in testing our source code, not in testing that, for instance,
  React updates the DOM as it should.

```jsx
it('should close the modal on pressing done button', () => {
    const handleClose = sinon.fake(); // A fake allows us to replace and assert on this function
    const wrapper = mount(
        <ConfirmationModal
            ...
            handleClose={handleClose}
        />
    );

    const doneButton = wrapper.find('#confirmation-modal-done-button').first();
    doneButton.simulate('click');
    wrapper.update();

    expect(handleClose.calledOnce).to.be.true;
});
```

### Stubs

Stubs do the same job but for object (and class) methods. Make sure to call `restore()` at
the end of the test, otherwise that same method will still be using the same stub in any
tests that run after it in the suite.

Stubs are also great for replacing functions that were imported into the module under test
from another module. Imagine, for instance, that we are testing a function that calls
`getErrors` from the `@/utils/validations.ts` module. We can replace the `getErrors`
helper method with our own, stubbed implementation:

```js
import * as validationHelpers from '@/utils/validations';
...
const getErrorsStub = sinon.stub(validationHelpers, 'getErrors').returns([]);

// call function under test and make assertions
getErrorsStub.restore();
```

Note how we import all the exports from the module as `validationHelpers`. This is because
we can only stub methods on an object. And since `getErrors` is a _named_
export<MarginNote id={5}>I know it's imaginary in this case, but it's most likely that a
validations file will make use of multiple named exports</MarginNote> of the module, we
need to first import all the methods an on object.

## Treat tests as source code

Some final advice. Just as you strive to make your source code readable, terse and
[DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself), you should aim for the same
in your tests. As requirements change and functionality is added, you or your colleagues
will have to revisit tests, updating them to reflect your new expectations of the
behaviour. You will be glad of any clarifying comments, any common mocks/helpers that have
been abstracted etc.

**NB**: when you find yourself having to reuse the same mocked object for multiple tests
you will want to lift it to some outer scope - of the `describe` block or the module - so
that it is available to all test blocks. **_Be careful!_** Since JS objects are assigned
by reference, every test will be using that object. If any one of them mutates the object,
it will be mutated for every test that runs after it. Consider writing a function that
returns that mocked object instead.
