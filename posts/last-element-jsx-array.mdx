<Dropcap>Poor</Dropcap> Jane. Her insightful, sensitive, entertaining work has been co-opted
by mysoginy, by people wanting to give Colin Firth something to do, and now by yet another
React tutorial. She'd probably have been into Vue; maybe she'd have considered rolling in the
muddy frontend obscene and opted for Lisp or Haskell. Never mind.

## Code that does things

This is pretty simple so I'm not going to bang on about Austen any longer. This is mostly
a reminder to myself, because although it's not overly complicated, it did trip me up for
a few minutes at work, and I wasn't totally sure what to search for to unblock myself.
Besides, I do hope, intrepid blog-burrower (that's you, my furry little reader), that it
is also useful to you.

### Let's assume an array of Power Rangers

PR fans (not Public Relations. They don't shout "it's morphing time!" do they?) will
notice that the names belong to the first lot of Power Rangers and that I've omitted the
Green guy. He later became the White Ranger, which I was never comfortable with. How could
I be? Way too big for his boots...

Here's how we could list out our heroes, putting an `<hr />` (horizontal rule) after each
but the last. First, we remember that the second argument of JavaScript's `.map()` array
function is an **index**. Then, we use it:

```JavaScript title=file.jsx
const powerRangers = [
  {
    color: 'Red',
    name: 'Jason Lee Scott'
  },
  {
    color: 'Yellow',
    name: 'Trini Kwan'
  },
  {
    color: 'Black',
    name: 'Zack Taylor'
  },
  {
    color: 'Pink',
    name: 'Kimberly Hart'
  },
  {
    color: 'Blue',
    name: 'Billy Cranston'
  }
]

const listOfRangers = () =>  (
  <ol>
    {powerRangers.map(({ color, name }, index) => (
      <>
        <li key={index}>
            {name} was the {color} Ranger
        </li>
        {index === powerRangers.length - 1 ? null : <hr />}
      </>
    ))}
  </ol>
)
```

That handy `<>` tag is the same as `React.Fragment`. Since we're rendering an `li` and an
`hr` as siblings (for all but the last Ranger), we need to wrap them in a parent element.
You could opt for a `div` if you were going to use it for something. Remember to move the
key attribute to it if you do.

Of course, it doesn't need to be the last element of the array. Once you have the current
index, you can do anything your bloody, pumping heart desires.
`index === 0 ? <hr /> : null` would add an `hr` after the first element only, for
instance. Anyway, happy mapping!
