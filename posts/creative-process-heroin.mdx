<p>
  <Dropcap>Nobody</Dropcap> has ever asked me why I enjoy limericks. Not one person on one
  single occasion. So it is in flagrant disregard of this unanimously mute wall of
  disinterest that I bring to you my totally unsolicited musings on the limerick as a
  form, the thoughts it has provoked regarding the experience of making things and, if
  we're really lucky, some growth
  <MarginNote id={1}>Let's hope that it's benign</MarginNote>.
</p>

For those who are unfamiliar, forgive me for popping your ignorant bliss-bubble. A
limerick is a poem consisting of five lines with an AABBA<MarginNote id={2}>I know, it's
almost <em>ABBA</em>, but sadly, no cigar. "The winner takes it all..."</MarginNote> rhyme
scheme. The commonest formula is to claim that so-and-so is from placey-place in the first
line. The rest is usually an outpouring of filth. But it's easy enough to keep it clean
and silly:

_There once was a man in a gutter_  
_Who found it most tricky to utter_  
_His very own name_  
_Which was really a shame_  
_And caused him quite often to mutter_

Feel free to bemoan the pointlessness of a verse like this. I don't expect anyone else to
get much joy out of it. But the fact is, and this is where we're straying into nauseating
confessional territory, I made it up in about 90 seconds. And it gave me _joy_. Not the
pitiful result - what is he muttering? And why? It really makes no sense - but the
creative process itself.

Now, we can't very well go around giving out A's for effort every time somebody points out
that making something _feels good_<MarginNote id={3}>Usually by taking your fat, furry ego
into your lap and giving it a good stroke until it purrs at a frequency that moves
mountains and, finally, burps contentedly, all the while giving you a smirk that says,
"What you gonna do about it?"</MarginNote>, but I do think it worth noting that the thing
you make, the results of your labour, no matter how grandly sweaty or pathetically dry, is
almost beside the point. You needn't produce a useful artifact that posterity will thank
you for. You don't even need to make something you're particularly proud of. You just need
to make it.

## On the subject of great makers

Why is it that those you admire greatly, those who have assembled dizzying towers of
genius and make you feel like a gormless pissant<MarginNote id={4}>I just looked this up.
I've only hitherto known it as a perjorative term. Not too surprisingly, it's also a type
of ant</MarginNote>, so often disavow their creations, seeming not exultantly triumphant
upon finishing their awesome monuments, but almost melancholic? Surely it was only a month
ago that Derek Brainy-McHandsome looked ready to storm Olympus when he was in the midst of
creation. But now that his revolutionary new garlic press is complete, and all that's left
to do is to watch it ruthlessly dominate the kitchen gadget market, I doubt he could storm
a cat flap.

Ask anyone who has made great things, and I mean _truly_ great, about their creations, and
I guarantee they will be itching to talk about the next instead. Listen to Rachmaninoff's
2nd and 3rd piano concertos<MarginNote id={5}>This is genuinely good advice for all
seasons, not just a pithy way of making a point; they are phenomenal</MarginNote> and you
will be questioning the point of his attempting a fourth. Congratulate Da Vinci on The
Last Supper and he'd probably have hushed you, immediately dragging you into a dark room
where he's dissecting a corpse and having a grand old time.

The best example really, is any writer worth a damn. A completed book is old news; it's
always about the next thing. And really, it's obvious why.

## Fickle sensation junkies

It's all about now. The present. No matter how wild a high you experienced while writing
that doom metal album that one reviewer gleefully dubbed "The sludgiest sounds going
around", your memories of those feelings are just farts in the wind. You will feel the
inconvenience of your having to wait five minutes for a bus more keenly, purely because
you are feeling it in that moment.

Oof, that's a bit bleak if you examine it with too powerful a microscope. Let's zoom out
and propose to shallow, glib solutions, if they can be so called.

## You're human, baby, get over it.

Stunning piece of advice that. Take it to heart.

If that doesn't do anything for you, it is worth considering two things. First, barring
some rather extreme misfortunes, you will always be able to carry on making things. Once
you have finished with one creation<MarginNote id={6}>Probably deciding that, though it
could be a lot better, you've been boring your friends with it for 3 years and you're
starting to lose their goodwill so best call it quits and move on</MarginNote>, you are
not _done_ creating, you are merely done with _that_ project. Pick up a new one. Make
something else. If you've exhausted your interest in one domain, dive into a new one. You
don't even have the excuse of lacking imagination anymore because the internet will just
take down its pants and show you the goods for free.

And second, you can easily have several projects on the go at once. In fact, I definitely
recommend it. Don't just have one idea that you feel you must absolutely follow through on
or else you'll simply weep all day for three years. Have several! When you feel unable to
continue with one - you're blocked, you're tired or maybe life just got in the way - then
plough on with another. And please, don't mistake this advice for a productivity tip. I'm
not advising anyone on how to get things done.

> Frankly, I think the value ascribed to finishing things is based on largely unexamined
> assumptions.

Rather, this is how I think we can carry on _doing and making things_:

1. Don't expect a finished project to bring you joy. You'll more likely feel empty. Start
   the next one immediately.
2. Have several on the go. If you have some enormous undertaking that's ongoing, I'd
   recommend trying to keep those ancillary projects small and silly. Like limericks, for
   example ðŸ˜‰

Have a quicky to keep you satisfied:

_It's said St Nick lost it one day,_  
_And drank whiskey when out in his sleigh._  
_The elves trying to stop him,_  
_Were torn limb from limb,_  
_When Santa felt he'd been betrayed._
