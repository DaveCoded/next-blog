<p>
  <Dropcap>Welcome</Dropcap> to a beautiful new post
</p>

What order do I put these in?!

Points:

- "Read the docs" is common advice from senior devs. It can be easy to dismiss it as "not
  for me". I know that I prefer to read books on technical topics when I want to go deep
  on them. That's all very well for a programming language, or for mature paradigms and
  methodologies, but there aren't books written on the latest JS framework. Most of the
  books written on the established ones are aimed at beginners anyway.
- Reading _all_ the documentation for something is a great way of getting an idea of the
  surface area. If it's a technology you use regularly, you _should_ know **about**
  everything it can do, if not how to do it. It will make your life easier!
- Reading docs will teach you about how to write your own documentation - public or
  internal - well/badly. Talk about what styled-components document well, and what is
  buried in the FAQs
- Frameworks, and to some extent libraries, were designed with certain patterns in mind.
  styled-components shows you good options for how to use it. Mui (at least v4) shows a
  lot of ways to override styles (look this up). It's fair enough to enumerate them, but
  you need some advice to use _one_ system and agree within your team. Otherwise you'll
  wind up with a mess. So don't think that the docs are everything. They were written by
  devs, some better than others, some more serious about docs than others.
- Credit JC
- Read more than the docs if you don't understand. Going to the source might be too far
  for some projects, but might be realistic for others, so try it. It's good practice just
  to peek at how OSS in your ecosystem is structured anyway!
  - Otherwise, find the posts written about it. If you're lucky, they'll be linked to from
    the docs!
- There are things I learned about styled-components **from** reading the docs, but there
  are also things I learned more generally **by** reading the docs.
- Solved text flickering on my blog!
- Information about the (incredibly useful) Babel plugin is off the beaten track - well,
  it's not in the normal installation/getting started instructions, but in a separate,
  slightly boring sounding section named "tooling"
- Issues with SSG; don't use `@import` in the `createGlobalStyle` function. Good to know!
  Think I'd done that when trying out some Google fonts and had some issues
- The `attrs` api looks very useful and "idiomatic", but the main bit of the docs is
  unclear about when it should be used. It's in the FAQ!
- Transient props look pretty vital, especially if you're also using TypeScript, which
  might fail to compile (check this?) if you're passing props to HTML elements that can't
  handle them.
- The "Test utilities" are buried in the API Reference, not the "Basics" or "Advanced"
  bits.
- I have probably said - maybe even in an interview or two - that I learn things by
  reading the docs. While I definitely dipped to find out answers to questions as I used
  the tool, that's not true; at least not to the extent I let on. But, instead of changing
  the story (so that I'm not telling porkies), it's sometimes a better idea to make the
  story into a reality and reap the benefits. (It's as much a lie I told myself as it is a
  lie I told to others!)
