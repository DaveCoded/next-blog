<!-- todo: define codemod in a tooltip on the word codemods! (create that definition component) -->
<Dropcap>Jscodeshift</Dropcap> is a library that helps us to run codemods on JavaScript source code. The CLI it provides lets us
execute a transform on many source files at once by spawning and managing workers. We also get some nicely formatted output
that tells us how many files were changed or if there were any errors.

It also provides a more convenient api for writing codemods, by wrapping [recast] and [ast-types] â€” shoutout to [Ben Newman] who
created _both_.

## But wait. What's a codemod?
